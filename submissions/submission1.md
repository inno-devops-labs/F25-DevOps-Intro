### The Importance of Signed Commits

Signed commits are a way to verify the authenticity of a commit. It is a way to ensure that the commit was made by the person who is claiming to have made it. This is important because it ensures that the commit is not made by someone else.

### The Benefits of Signed Commits
1. Authenticity - shows who made the commit
2. Persistence - ensures the commit is not lost
3. Incapsulation - works only within repository network
