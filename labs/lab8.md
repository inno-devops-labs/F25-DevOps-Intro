## Overview

In this lab you will practice:
- Monitoring system resources (CPU, memory, I/O) and identifying resource bottlenecks.
- Managing disk space and identifying large files.
- Setting up real-time website monitoring with availability, content validation, and performance checks.
- Configuring alerting for proactive issue detection.

These skills are essential for ensuring system reliability and maintaining SLAs in production environments.

## Tasks

### Task 1 ‚Äî Key Metrics for SRE and System Analysis (4 pts)

**Objective:** Monitor system resources and manage disk space.

#### 1.1: Monitor System Resources

1. **Install Monitoring Tools (if needed):**

   ```bash
   sudo apt install htop sysstat -y
   ```

2. **Monitor CPU, Memory, and I/O Usage:**

   ```bash
   htop
   iostat -x 1 5
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>üîç Understanding iostat output</summary>

   - `%user`: CPU time in user space
   - `%system`: CPU time in kernel space
   - `%iowait`: CPU waiting for I/O operations
   - `%idle`: CPU idle time

   </details>

3. **Identify Top Resource Consumers:**

   Find the top 3 most consuming applications for:
   - **CPU usage**
   - **Memory usage**
   - **I/O usage**

#### 1.2: Disk Space Management

1. **Check Disk Usage:**

   ```bash
   df -h
   du -h /var | sort -rh | head -n 10
   ```

2. **Identify Largest Files:**

   ```bash
   sudo find /var -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 3
   ```

In `labs/submission8.md`, document:
- Top 3 most consuming applications for CPU, memory, and I/O usage
- Command outputs showing resource consumption
- Top 3 largest files in the `/var` directory
- Analysis: What patterns do you observe in resource utilization?
- Reflection: How would you optimize resource usage based on your findings?

### Task 2 ‚Äî Practical Website Monitoring Setup (6 pts)

**Objective:** Set up real-time monitoring for any website using Checkly with availability checks, content validation, interaction performance, and alerting.

#### 2.1: Choose Your Website

1. **Select Target Website:**

   Pick ANY public website you want to monitor (e.g., your favorite store, news site, or portfolio)

#### 2.2: Create Checks in Checkly

1. **Sign Up:**

   - Create a free account at [Checkly](https://checklyhq.com/)

2. **Create API Check for Basic Availability:**

   <details>
   <summary>üí° What to configure</summary>

   - **URL:** Your chosen website
   - **Assertion:** Status code is 200
   - **Frequency:** Choose appropriate check interval

   </details>

3. **Create Browser Check for Content & Interactions:**

   <details>
   <summary>üí° What to test</summary>

   Examples of what you can check:
   - Is a specific text/element visible on the page?
   - Does a button click work?
   - How long does page load take?
   - Can you fill out a form?

   Choose checks that make sense for your selected website.

   </details>

#### 2.3: Set Up Alerts

1. **Configure Alert Rules:**

   Design alert rules of YOUR choice:
   - What to alert on? (e.g., failed checks, slow latency, downtime)
   - How to be notified? (email, Telegram, Slack, etc.)
   - Set thresholds that make sense for your site

#### 2.4: Capture Proof & Documentation

1. **Run Checks Manually:**

   - Verify all checks work correctly
   - Observe the monitoring dashboard

2. **Take Screenshots:**

   Capture screenshots showing:
   - Your browser check configuration
   - A successful check result
   - Your alert settings
   - Dashboard overview

In `labs/submission8.md`, document:
- Website URL you chose to monitor
- Screenshots of browser check configuration
- Screenshots of successful check results
- Screenshots of alert settings
- Analysis: Why did you choose these specific checks and thresholds?
- Reflection: How does this monitoring setup help maintain website reliability?

<summary>üí° SRE Tips</summary>

1. Focus on metrics that matter - availability, latency, and error rates.
2. Set realistic alert thresholds to avoid alert fatigue.
3. Monitor user-facing functionality, not just server health.
4. Document your reasoning for chosen monitoring strategies.

<summary>üîç Monitoring Best Practices</summary>

1. **The Four Golden Signals:**
   - Latency: How long does it take?
   - Traffic: How much demand?
   - Errors: How many failures?
   - Saturation: How full is the system?

2. **Alert Design:**
   - Alert on symptoms, not causes
   - Make alerts actionable
   - Avoid alert fatigue with proper thresholds
