## Overview

In this lab you will practice:
- Managing **declarative configuration** using Git as the source of truth.
- Implementing **automated reconciliation loops** to detect and fix drift.
- Building **self-healing systems** that continuously sync desired state.
- Monitoring **state synchronization health** with checksums and logging.

These simulations mirror how real GitOps tools (ArgoCD, Flux) work, helping you understand the fundamentals before using production tools.

## Tasks

### Task 1 — Git State Reconciliation (6 pts)

**Objective:** Simulate how GitOps operators continuously synchronize cluster state with Git as the source of truth.

#### 1.1: Initialize Git Repository and Desired State

1. **Initialize Repository:**

   ```bash
   mkdir gitops-lab && cd gitops-lab
   git init
   ```

2. **Create Desired State (Source of Truth):**

   ```bash
   echo "version: 1.0" > desired-state.txt
   echo "app: myapp" >> desired-state.txt
   echo "replicas: 3" >> desired-state.txt
   git add . && git commit -m "feat: initial desired state"
   ```

3. **Simulate Current Cluster State:**

   ```bash
   cp desired-state.txt current-state.txt
   echo "Initial state synchronized"
   ```

#### 1.2: Create Reconciliation Loop

1. **Create Reconciliation Script:**

   Create a file named `reconcile.sh`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # reconcile.sh - GitOps reconciliation loop
   
   DESIRED=$(cat desired-state.txt)
   CURRENT=$(cat current-state.txt)
   
   if [ "$DESIRED" != "$CURRENT" ]; then
       echo "$(date) - ⚠️  DRIFT DETECTED!"
       echo "Reconciling current state with desired state..."
       cp desired-state.txt current-state.txt
       echo "$(date) - ✅ Reconciliation complete"
   else
       echo "$(date) - ✅ States synchronized"
   fi
   ```

2. **Make Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x reconcile.sh
   ```

#### 1.3: Test Manual Drift Detection

1. **Simulate Manual Drift:**

   ```bash
   echo "version: 2.0" > current-state.txt
   echo "app: myapp" >> current-state.txt
   echo "replicas: 5" >> current-state.txt
   ```

2. **Run Reconciliation Manually:**

   ```bash
   ./reconcile.sh
   diff desired-state.txt current-state.txt
   ```

3. **Verify Drift Was Fixed:**

   ```bash
   cat current-state.txt
   ```

#### 1.4: Automated Continuous Reconciliation

1. **Start Continuous Reconciliation Loop:**

   ```bash
   watch -n 5 ./reconcile.sh
   ```

   <details>
   <summary>💡 Understanding watch command</summary>

   `watch -n 5` runs the command every 5 seconds, similar to how GitOps tools continuously sync state.

   Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the watch process.

   </details>

2. **In Another Terminal, Trigger Drift:**

   ```bash
   cd gitops-lab
   echo "replicas: 10" >> current-state.txt
   ```

3. **Observe Auto-Healing:**

   Watch the reconciliation loop automatically detect and fix the drift within 5 seconds.

In `labs/submission7.md`, document:
- Initial desired-state.txt and current-state.txt contents
- Screenshot or output of drift detection and reconciliation
- Output showing synchronized state after reconciliation
- Output from continuous reconciliation loop detecting auto-healing
- Analysis: Explain the GitOps reconciliation loop. How does this prevent configuration drift?
- Reflection: What advantages does declarative configuration have over imperative commands in production?

### Task 2 — GitOps Health Monitoring (4 pts)

**Objective:** Implement health checks for configuration synchronization and build proactive monitoring.

#### 2.1: Create Health Check Script

1. **Create Health Check Script:**

   Create a file named `healthcheck.sh`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # healthcheck.sh - Monitor GitOps sync health
   
   DESIRED_MD5=$(md5sum desired-state.txt | awk '{print $1}')
   CURRENT_MD5=$(md5sum current-state.txt | awk '{print $1}')
   
   if [ "$DESIRED_MD5" != "$CURRENT_MD5" ]; then
       echo "$(date) - ❌ CRITICAL: State mismatch detected!" | tee -a health.log
       echo "  Desired MD5: $DESIRED_MD5" | tee -a health.log
       echo "  Current MD5: $CURRENT_MD5" | tee -a health.log
   else
       echo "$(date) - ✅ OK: States synchronized" | tee -a health.log
   fi
   ```

2. **Make Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x healthcheck.sh
   ```

#### 2.2: Test Health Monitoring

1. **Test Healthy State:**

   ```bash
   ./healthcheck.sh
   cat health.log
   ```

2. **Simulate Configuration Drift:**

   ```bash
   echo "unapproved-change: true" >> current-state.txt
   ```

3. **Run Health Check on Drifted State:**

   ```bash
   ./healthcheck.sh
   cat health.log
   ```

4. **Fix Drift and Verify:**

   ```bash
   ./reconcile.sh
   ./healthcheck.sh
   cat health.log
   ```

#### 2.3: Continuous Health Monitoring

1. **Create Combined Monitoring Script:**

   Create a file named `monitor.sh`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # monitor.sh - Combined reconciliation and health monitoring
   
   echo "Starting GitOps monitoring..."
   for i in {1..10}; do
       echo "\n--- Check #$i ---"
       ./healthcheck.sh
       ./reconcile.sh
       sleep 3
   done
   ```

   ```bash
   chmod +x monitor.sh
   ```

2. **Run Monitoring Loop:**

   ```bash
   ./monitor.sh
   ```

3. **Review Complete Health Log:**

   ```bash
   cat health.log
   ```

In `labs/submission7.md`, document:
- Contents of healthcheck.sh script
- Output showing "OK" status when states match
- Output showing "CRITICAL" status when drift is detected
- Complete health.log file showing multiple checks
- Output from monitor.sh showing continuous monitoring
- Analysis: How do checksums (MD5) help detect configuration changes?
- Comparison: How does this relate to GitOps tools like ArgoCD's "Sync Status"?

<summary>📚 GitOps Concepts</summary>

| Task | GitOps Principle           | Real-World Equivalent                 |
| ---- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Continuous Reconciliation  | ArgoCD/Flux sync loops                |
| 2    | Health Monitoring          | Kubernetes operator status checks     |

**GitOps Philosophy:**
1. **Git as Single Source of Truth** - All configuration changes go through Git.
2. **Declarative Configuration** - Define the desired state, not the steps to get there.
3. **Automated Reconciliation** - Systems continuously sync to match Git state.
4. **Self-Healing** - Drift is automatically corrected without manual intervention.
