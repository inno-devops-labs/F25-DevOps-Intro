Signing commits (with GPG, SSH, or S/MIME) helps to:

1. **Prove authorship** – ensures the commit truly comes from the person who owns the signing key.

2. **Protect integrity** – prevents undetected tampering with commit history, as the signature is cryptographically verifiable.

3. **Build trust** – signed commits are marked as Verified on GitHub, making code review and collaboration more secure.

4. **Support auditing and compliance** – even if a key is rotated or revoked later, the verification record persists, ensuring stable contribution history.
