# Signing commits with SSH or GPG provides important benefits:

- It confirms the author’s identity, ensuring the commit was made by the real key owner.
- It guarantees data integrity, so the commit cannot be altered without detection.
- It protects against forge and tampering with the project history.
- On GitHub, signed commits get a “Verified” badge, increasing trust in the code.
- SSH signing is easier to set up if you already use SSH keys for authentication.
  
Signed commits help secure code, prove authenticity, and build confidence in collaborative development.
This concise summary fits well for the submission task on commit signing benefits.
