# Signing Commits

Signing commits (with *GPG*, *SSH*, or *S/MIME*) ensures that others can trust the origin of your changes.
When a commit is signed and the signature is successfully verified, GitHub marks it as “Verified”, showing that it came from a trusted source. This helps protect the integrity and authenticity of the project’s history, making it clear that commits weren’t tampered with and really came from you.
