## Overview

In this lab you will practice:
- Setting up virtualization platforms across different operating systems.
- Deploying and configuring virtual machines with modern Linux distributions.
- Using command-line tools for system information gathering and analysis.
- Documenting virtualization workflows for cross-platform environments.

These skills are essential for DevOps infrastructure management and system administration.

## Tasks

### Task 1 — VirtualBox Installation (5 pts)

**Objective:** Install VirtualBox on your host operating system.

#### 1.1: Install VirtualBox

1. **Download and Install:**

   - Download VirtualBox from [https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
   - Install using the GUI installer with default settings
   - Restart if prompted

2. **Verify Installation:**

   - Launch VirtualBox and note the version number

In `labs/submission5.md`, document:
- Host operating system and version (e.g., "Windows 11 Pro 23H2", "macOS Sonoma 14.1", "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS")
- VirtualBox version number
- Any installation issues encountered

### Task 2 — Ubuntu VM and System Analysis (5 pts)

**Objective:** Deploy Ubuntu 24.04 LTS in VirtualBox and discover tools to analyze system information.

#### 2.1: Create Ubuntu VM

1. **VM Setup:**

   - Download Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ISO from [https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
   - Create new VM in VirtualBox with:
     - RAM: 4GB minimum (8GB recommended)
     - Storage: 25GB minimum
     - CPU: 2 cores minimum
   - Install Ubuntu using the default installation process

#### 2.2: System Information Discovery

1. **Find Tools to Gather Information:**

   Research and discover command-line tools that can provide:
   - **CPU Details**: Processor model, architecture, cores, frequency
   - **Memory Information**: Total RAM, available memory
   - **Network Configuration**: IP addresses, network interfaces
   - **Storage Information**: Disk usage, filesystem details
   - **Operating System**: Ubuntu version, kernel information
   - **Virtualization Detection**: Confirmation system is running in a VM

In `labs/submission5.md`, document:
- VM configuration specifications used (RAM, storage, CPU cores)
- For each information type above:
  - Tool name(s) you discovered
  - Command(s) used
  - Complete command output
- Brief reflection on which tools were most useful and why

## Guidelines

- Use clear Markdown headers to organize sections in `submission5.md`.
- Include complete command outputs with proper formatting.
- Document your tool discovery process and reasoning.

> **Installation Notes**  
> 1. Download software only from official websites.  
> 2. Use default installation settings unless you have specific requirements.  
> 3. Ensure your host system has sufficient resources before creating VMs.

> **Tool Discovery Tips**  
> 1. Start with built-in Linux commands before installing additional packages.  
> 2. Use package managers (apt) to search for system information tools.  
> 3. Test multiple tools and compare their outputs.  
> 4. Document which tools provide the most useful information.
