# Benefits of Signing Commits

Signed commits provide cryptographic proof of authorship. This ensures that the commit truly comes from the claimed developer and has not been modified afterward. The main benefits are:

- **Authenticity**: Verifies that commits were created by a trusted source.  
- **Integrity**: Detects if commit history was altered or tampered with.  
- **Accountability**: Ties commits directly to an individualâ€™s verified identity.  
- **Security in Collaboration**: Protects against malicious actors pushing unverified or fake commits in shared repositories.  
- **Compliance**: Some organizations require signed commits for audit and regulatory purposes.  

SSH commit signature verification strengthens security by using secure keys already managed for repository access, reducing reliance on weaker authentication methods.
Also, helpful in deployment: when you work in terminal of server with private repository.
