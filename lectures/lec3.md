# 📌Lecture 3 - CI/CD

## 📍 Slide 1 – 🌍 What is CI/CD?

* 💡 **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers frequently merge their code into a shared Version Control System (VCS). Each integration is verified by an automated build and tests.
* 💡 **Continuous Delivery (CD)**: Every build is automatically prepared for release, ensuring the software is always in a deployable state.
* 💡 **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Extends delivery by automatically releasing every passing build to production.
* 🔄 Together, CI/CD is like a **factory assembly line for software** — automated, repeatable, and reliable.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Some companies deploy thousands of times per day (Amazon reportedly every 11.7 seconds).

## 📍 Slide 4 – 🏗️ Core Principles of Continuous Integration

* 📝 **Commit early, commit often**: Small, frequent changes are easier to test.
* 🔄 **Automate builds & tests**: Every commit triggers an automated pipeline.
* 📂 **Single source of truth**: Code lives in a shared repository (e.g., Git).
* 🚨 **Fail fast**: If a build fails, it alerts the team immediately.
* 🧹 **Keep main branch clean**: Always ready to deploy.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: The term “integration hell” described the pain of merging code once every few weeks — CI was born to fix this.

## 📍 Slide 5 – 🔄 CI Workflow (Commit → Build → Test → Package)

* 👨‍💻 Developer pushes commit to repository.
* 🔄 CI server detects change and **triggers pipeline**.
* ⚙️ **Build stage** compiles source code.
* 🧪 **Testing stage** runs unit/integration tests.
* 📦 **Packaging stage** produces deployable artifacts (e.g., Docker image, JAR file).
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Google has one of the world’s largest CI systems, building **tens of thousands** of changes daily across a monorepo.

## 📍 Slide 10 – 🚚 Continuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment

* 🚚 **Continuous Delivery**: Code is always in a **deployable state**, but human approval may be required to push to production.
* 🤖 **Continuous Deployment**: Every change that passes the pipeline is **automatically deployed** without human intervention.
* 📊 Key difference = “Who presses the button?”
* 🏢 In practice: Many enterprises use Delivery for **control**, startups often use Deployment for **speed**.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Facebook is famous for continuous deployment, releasing code **twice per day** for over a billion users.

## 📍 Slide 13 – 🌱 Blue-Green Deployment (Concept & History)

* 🌱 **Two environments**: one “Blue” (active) and one “Green” (idle).
* 🔄 Traffic can switch instantly between them.
* 🏗️ Purpose: zero-downtime deployments.
* 📜 **Origin of the name**: First described in the book *Continuous Delivery* (2010).
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Blue-Green is often compared to a “light switch” — flip users from old version to new version instantly.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Users[👥 Users] --> LB[⚖️ Load Balancer]
  LB --> Blue[🌱 Blue Env v1]
  LB -.switch.-> Green[🌱 Green Env v2]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 14 – 🏢 Blue-Green Deployment (Real-World Use Cases)

* 📦 **E-commerce sites**: Release new versions without interrupting checkout flows.
* 🎬 **Netflix**: Uses Blue-Green to roll out streaming service updates globally.
* 🏥 **Healthcare apps**: Critical uptime means “no maintenance windows.”
* 🛑 Rollback is simple → just point traffic back to the Blue environment.
* ⚠️ Drawback: Requires **double infrastructure**.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User as 👥 User
  participant Blue as 🌱 Blue (Old)
  participant Green as 🌱 Green (New)

  User->>Blue: Normal traffic
  Note over User,Blue: Deployment prepared
  User-->>Green: Switch traffic
  Note over User,Green: Rollback? Switch back!
```

---

## 📍 Slide 15 – 🐤 Canary Deployment (Concept & History)

* 🐤 **Name origin**: Inspired by “canary in a coal mine” (used to detect danger early).
* 🔄 Deploy new version to **small % of users** first.
* 📊 Monitor performance and errors closely.
* ⚖️ If stable → gradually increase rollout to all users.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Google pioneered large-scale canary rollouts in Chrome updates.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Users[👥 Users] --> LB[⚖️ Load Balancer]
  LB --> Canary[🐤 Canary Servers 5%]
  LB --> Stable[✅ Stable Servers 95%]
```

---

## 📍 Slide 16 – 🚏 Canary Deployment (Real-World Examples)

* 🔍 **Google**: Chrome browser rollouts — small group, then worldwide.
* 📱 **Mobile apps**: Canary updates allow staged rollouts in App Stores.
* 🎮 **Game servers**: Online games canary deploy to avoid massive failures.
* 🛑 If failure detected → rollout stops automatically.
* ⚠️ Drawback: Monitoring must be strong, or bad code still spreads.

```mermaid

```

---

## 📍 Slide 17 – 🧪 A/B Testing (Concept & History)

* 🧪 **Origin**: Borrowed from marketing experiments (A vs B groups).
* 👥 Users are split into groups to test **different versions** simultaneously.
* 🎯 Goal: Compare user behavior → which version performs better?
* 🛠️ Often used for UI/UX changes, not just backend features.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Google once tested **41 shades of blue** to optimize link color.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Users[👥 Users] --> GroupA[A: Old Version]
  Users --> GroupB[B: New Version]
  GroupA --> Metrics[📊 Compare Results]
  GroupB --> Metrics
```

---

## 📍 Slide 18 – 🏆 A/B Testing (Real-World Use Cases)

* 🏢 **Facebook**: Runs continuous experiments for new features.
* 🛒 **Amazon**: Tests recommendation algorithms and checkout flows.
* 📰 **News sites**: Compare headlines to maximize clicks.
* 🛑 Drawback: Higher complexity — must manage multiple active versions.
* ✅ Benefit: Data-driven decisions → not just “gut feeling.”

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UserA as User Group A
  participant UserB as User Group B
  UserA->>App: Old version experience
  UserB->>App: New version experience
  App->>Analytics: Collect results
  Analytics->>Team: Compare metrics & decide
```

---

## 📍 Slide 19 – 🔄 Rolling & Shadow Deployments

* 🔄 **Rolling Deployment**: Gradually replace old servers with new ones, one batch at a time.
* 👻 **Shadow Deployment**: Deploy new version in parallel → receives real traffic but **responses are discarded**.
* 🎯 Purpose: Observe performance under real-world load.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Shadow deployments are sometimes called **“dark launches”** — users don’t know they’re happening.
* ⚠️ Rolling is safer than full switch, but slower to complete.

```mermaid

## 📍 Slide 21 – 🔄 Event-Driven Pipelines (Triggers)

* ⏰ **Commit triggers**: Push or PR initiates pipeline.
* 🛠️ **Manual triggers**: Developer clicks a button to run jobs.
* 🕵️ **Schedule triggers**: Cron-like jobs (nightly builds).
* 🌐 **Webhook triggers**: Events from external systems (e.g., Docker image update).
* 🔑 **Why important?** → Automation reduces human delays.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Some teams run **“shadow pipelines”** on every branch to test risky code.

```mermaid

## 📍 Slide 22 – 📝 Pipelines as Code

* 🛠️ Pipelines defined in **configuration files** (`Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, GitHub Actions YAML).
* 📂 Stored in **same repository** → version-controlled with code.
* 🔄 Changes to pipeline follow same workflow (PRs, reviews).
* 📦 Enables **reproducible, shareable, auditable** CI/CD workflows.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: GitLab was the first major CI system to make pipelines *mandatory as code*.

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions workflow
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3   # Fetch code
      - run: npm install            # Install dependencies
      - run: npm test               # Run tests
```

## 📍 Slide 23 – 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Branching Models with CI/CD

* 🌱 **Feature branches**: Isolate new features, merged after review.
* 🌳 **GitFlow**: Structured model with develop + release + hotfix branches.
* 🚂 **Trunk-based development**: Everyone commits directly to main, small changes, CI ensures stability.
* ⚖️ Choice depends on **team size, risk tolerance, and release cadence**.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Google uses trunk-based dev with **single monorepo for all products**.

```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit id: "main"
  branch develop
  commit id: "feature-x"
  branch feature
  commit id: "work"
  checkout develop
  merge feature id: "merge feature-x"
  checkout main
  merge develop id: "release"
```

---

## 📍 Slide 24 – ⚡ Pipeline Optimization Techniques

* 🏎️ **Parallel jobs**: Run tests/builds simultaneously to save time.
* 💾 **Caching**: Reuse dependencies instead of reinstalling each build.
* 🎯 **Selective builds**: Only build/test parts of the project that changed.
* 🔄 **Reusable templates**: Share common pipeline steps across projects.
* 📊 **Monitoring performance**: Identify bottlenecks → optimize stages.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: At scale, even **1-minute savings** per build can save **hundreds of developer hours per week**.

```mermaid

## 📍 Slide 25 – 🐳 CI/CD with Containers (Docker & Podman)

* 🐳 Containers make builds **reproducible** → “works everywhere.”
* 🔄 CI/CD pipelines build Docker images automatically after tests.
* 📦 Images are pushed to registries (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
* 🚀 Deployment uses the same image across dev → staging → prod.
* 🤓 **Fun fact**: Spotify built a CI/CD system to generate **1000s of Docker images daily** for microservices.

```yaml
# Example: GitHub Actions to build Docker image
jobs:
  docker-build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: docker build -t myapp:latest .
